# Angular Trello Clone

A small Trello clone built with Angular Material UI and NgRx. This project was a part of [Grid Dynamics](https://www.griddynamics.com) internship.

## Usage

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
